## API & Deployment

This is the backend for Margarita Mania, a single page application created using create-react-app and react router.

To check out the GitHub repo for the UI [click here.](https://github.com/mariareedstrom/margarita-ui)

For the API for this project I used json-server.

It was deployed using Heroku.
[Check it out here.](https://margarita-mania.herokuapp.com/margaritas)

On page load, a fetch request is made to retreive all margaritas. Further more, POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests are made to add new, set to favorites, and remove margaritas.
